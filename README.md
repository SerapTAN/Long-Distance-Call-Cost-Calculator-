# Long-Distance-Call-Cost-Calculator-
A C++ console application that calculates long-distance call costs based on call duration and time-based rate categories. The program emphasizes accurate input validation, clear user interaction, and modular program design.

## Features
- Calculates call cost based on duration
- Applies time-based rate rules
- Validates user input
- Clean and readable console output

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Input/Output
- Conditional logic

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
2. Run the executable
3. Enter call duration and time period when prompted

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved C++ fundamentals
- Input validation
- Modular logic design
